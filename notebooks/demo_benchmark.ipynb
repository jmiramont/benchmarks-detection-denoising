    "## What is this benchmark?\n",
    "A benchmark is a comparison between different methods when running an standardized test. The goal of this benchmark is to compare different methods for denoising / detecting a signal based on different characterizations of the of the time-frequency representation of the signal. This particular benchmark has been created for evaluating the performance of techniques based on the zeros of the spectrogram and to contrast them with more traditional methods, like those based on the ridges of that time-frequency distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, with the purpose of making this benchmark more useful, the methods to compare, the tests, and the performance evaluation functions were conceived as different modules, so that one can assess new methods without modifing the tests. The only restriction this pose is that the methods should satisfy some requirements regarding the shape of their input an output parameters.  On the one hand, the tests and the performance evaluation functions, are encapsulated in the class `Benchmark`. On the other hand, the signals used in this benchmark are generated by the methods in the class `SignalBank`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare different methods with possibly different parameters, we need to set up a few things before running the benchmark. A `Benchmark` object receives some input parameters to configure the test:\n",
    "- `task`: This could be `'denoising'` or `'detection'`. The first one compute the quality reconstruction factor (QRF) using the output of the method, whereas the second simply consist in detecting whether a signal is present or not.\n",
    "- `N`: The length of the simulation, i.e. how many samples should the signals have.\n",
    "- `methods`: A dictionary of methods. Each entry of this dictionary corresponds to the function that implements each of the desired methods.\n",
    "- `parameters`: A dictionary of parameters. Each entry of this dictionary corresponds to an array of tuples to pass as input parameters to each method. In order to know which parameters should be passed to each methods, the keys of this dictionary should be the same as those corresponding to the individual methods in the corresponding dictionary. An example of this is showed below.\n",
    "- `SNRin`: A list or tuple of values of SNR to test.\n",
    "- `repetitions`: The number of times the experiment should be repeated with different realizations of noise."

    "## A dummy test \n",
    "First let us define a dummy method for testing. Methods should receive a numpy array with shape  ```(N,)``` where `N` is the number of time samples of the signal. Additionally, they can receive any number of positional or keyword arguments to allow testing different combinations of input parameters. The shape of the output depends on the task (signal denoising or detection). So the recommended signature of a method should be the following:\n",
